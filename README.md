# Walter Orr Roberts Papers
## Description
Internationally celebrated solar astronomer and professor of Astro-Geophysics, Walter Orr Roberts (1915-1990), was a principal figure in many scientific developments in Colorado. Superintendent of the High Altitude Observatory in Climax, Colorado from 1940 to 1957, Roberts served as director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder from its founding in 1960 until 1968. This curated collection of material from the Walter Orr Roberts Papers reflects the major research and everyday operation of the High Altitude Observatory, the founding of NCAR, and the design and construction of the first solar coronograph telescope in the Western Hemisphere, among other topics.
